# Overview

Create an app to view the current weather in these cities:

- Toronto
- Ottawa
- Montreal

## Requirements

- Use weather API from https://openweathermap.org/current#name
- Ability to switch between the cities and see the current weather for that city
- Show a loading state while the weather for that city is loading
- Commit your changes to GitHub and email back a link to your repo
  - Please create a new repo on your account insdead of forking. We don't want other candidates looking at your solution.

## Example implementation

### Loading state

![Loading state](./docs/loading.png)

### Current weather

## Getting started

- Ensure [`yarn` is installed on your machine](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/getting-started).
- Run `yarn`
- Run `yarn start` to start the project.

The project is set up using `styled-components` for styling. If you're more
comfortable using plain CSS or another styling method / component library,
feel free to use that instead.

You don't have to style your implementation the same way as the example. Feel
free to be creative and style it however you think makes sense.

The task is expected to take 2-4 hours.
